A simple C++ library for packing and unpacking OSC packets.


Oscpack is simply a set of C++ classes for packing and unpacking OSC packets. 
Oscpack includes a minimal set of UDP networking classes for windows and posix 
which are sufficient for writing many OSC applications and servers, but you are 
encouraged to use another networking framework if it better suits your needs. 
Oscpack is not an OSC application framework, it doesn't include infrastructure for 
constructing or routing OSC namespaces, just classes for easily constructing, 
sending, receiving and parsing OSC packets. The library should also be easy to use 
for other transport methods (eg serial).

The key goals of the oscpack library are:

	- to be a simple and complete implementation of OSC
	- to be portable to a wide variety of platforms
	- to allow easy development of robust OSC applications 
		(for example it should be impossible to crash a server
		 by sending it malformed packets, and difficult to 
		 create malformed packets.)

Here's a summary of the key files:

osc/OscReceivedElements -- classes for parsing a packet
osc/OscPrintRecievedElements -- iostream << operators for printing packet elements
osc/OscOutboundPacket -- a class for packing messages into a packet
osc/OscPacketListener -- base class for listening to OSC packets on a UdpSocket
osc/OscUnitTests -- unit test program for the OSC modules
osc/OscDump -- a program that prints received OSC packets
osc/OscSendTests -- examples of how to send messages
osc/OscReceiveTest -- example of how to receive the messages sent by OSCSendTests

If you fix anything or write a set of TCP send/recieve classes 
please consider sending me a patch. Thanks :)

Thanks to Till Bovermann for helping with POSIX networking code and
Mac compatibility, and to Martin Kaltenbrunner and the rest of the
reacTable team for giving me a reason to finish this library. Thanks
to Merlijn Blaauw for reviewing the interface.
