A simple C++ library for packing and unpacking OSC packets.


Oscpack is simply a set of C++ classes for packing and unpacking OSC packets.
Oscpack is not a networking library, or a framework for bulding OSC
applications. Simple classes for UDP networking are included, but you are
encouraged to use another networking framework. The library should also be
easy to use for other transport methods (eg serial).

The key goals of this library are:

	- to be a simple and complete implementation of OSC
	- to be portable to a wide variety of platforms
	- to allow easy development of robust OSC applications 
		(for example it should be impossible to crash a server
		 by sending it malformed packets, and difficult to 
		 create malformed packets.)

Here's a summary of the key files:

OscReceivedElements -- classes for parsing a packet
OscPrintRecievedElements -- iostream << operators for printing packet elements
OscOutboundPacket -- a class for packing messages into a packet
OscPacketListener -- base class for listening to OSC packets on a UdpSocket
OscUnitTests -- unit test program for the OSC modules
OscDump -- a program that prints received OSC packets
OscSendTests -- examples of how to send messages
OscReceiveTest -- example of how to receive the messages sent by OSCSendTests

If you fix anything or write a set of TCP send/recieve classes 
please consider sending me a patch. Thanks :)

Thanks to Till Bovermann for helping with POSIX networking code and
Mac compatibility, and to Martin Kaltenbrunner and the rest of the
reacTable team for giving me a reason to finish this library. Thanks
to Merlijn Blaauw for reviewing the interface.
